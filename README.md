Cerberus: Provenance API Web Service
====================================

Cerberus is intended as a web service wrapper for the existing GSI Provenance API: https://github.com/oicr-gsi/provenance

Goals of Cerberus include:
- Encapsulating the file provenance code and its dependencies for ease of use
- Improved speed and efficiency, eg. by caching
- Allow provenance data to be consumed in non-Java languages

The Cerberus project was started in May 2018 and is currently in a rough draft state.
